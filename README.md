# ChangelogGenerator

_Note_: This is just a side-project, learning/work-in-progress kind of thing.

In other words: **IT DOES NOT WORK!**. It might at some point in time though ðŸ˜‰

## Building

To build the generator run:

```bash
swift build -c release
```

After that check the `.build/release/` directory
